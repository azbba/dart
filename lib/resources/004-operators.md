## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign value to a variable.

| Operator      | Description                 | Example                                        |
|---------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **=**         | Assignment operator         | ```dart int age = 30;```                       |
| **+=**        | Add add assign              | ```dart age += 5; // 30 + 5 = 35```            |
| **-=**        | Subtract and assign         | ```dart age -= 5; // 30 -5 = 25```             |
| ***=**        | Multiply and assign         | ```dart age *= 2; // 30 * 2 = 60```            |
| **/=**        | Divide and assign           | ```dart age /= 2; // 30 / 2 = 15```            |
| **~/=**       | Divide and assign (integer) | ```dart age ~/= 7; // 30; 30 / 7 = 4.28 = 4``` |
| **%=**        | Mod and assign              | ```dart age %= 7: // 30 % 7 = 28 - 30 = 2```   |
